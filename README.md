# neXus - A Comprehensive Graph Algorithm Library for C++

Nexus is a powerful and user-friendly C++ library designed to simplify the creation and manipulation of graphs. Whether you're a competitive programmer, student, or developer, Nexus provides a seamless way to implement various graph algorithms, such as DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, cycle detection, and more.

## Features
  *Easy Graph Creation: Effortlessly create and manage graphs using simple commands like nexus.addNode().
  *Comprehensive Algorithms: Implement a wide range of graph algorithms with minimal code, including depth-first search (DFS), 
   breadth-first search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, cycle detection, and more.

## Why Nexus?

Nexus was built to address the challenges of working with graphs in competitive programming and academic settings. With a focus on ease of use, it allows you to concentrate on problem-solving rather than the intricacies of graph implementation.
